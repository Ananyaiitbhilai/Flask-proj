About Us 
Flite -This app is aimed to give the user transparency in booking flights. The user can easily compare what a flight should cost to what it does cost, and make the decision to book a flight accordingly.

How it works:
Flite - Bookin uses Sambre API to get predicted flight prices and compares it to the lowest available flight on Google flights . Event information is provided by Eventbrite . All data is saved locally, therefore flight recommendations are based off the travel period Sept 20 - Sept 30 with the booking date as August 10. Event data is based off what was available via Eventbrite August 10, 2020.
